                    <li><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps,<br> 
                        helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
                    <li><b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
                    <li><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, <br>
                        he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
                    <li><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. <br>
                        Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants,<br>
                         and other applied science.</li>
                    <li><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                    <li><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife,<br>
                         and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years,<br>
                          his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for <br>
                          each major climate on Earth.</li>
                    <li><b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                    <li><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,<br> 
                        creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                    <li><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in <br>
                        time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>
                    <li><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                    <li><b>1983 </b>- helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
                    <li><b>1984 </b>- becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
                    <li><b>2005 </b>- states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050.<br>
                        " Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand,<br> 
                        as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been<br>
                        genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,<br> 
                        people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
                    <li><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
